To understand the influence of the parents background, test preparation etc on students performance
 Step 1: I define the Problem Clearly
"Why do some students perform better in math than reading?"
Break it down:
Are math scores generally higher or lower than reading?
Are there specific groups (e.g., by gender or education level) showing this pattern?
What could influence the scores (test prep, lunch type, etc.)?
Step 2: group by
Gender
Parental education level
Step 3: I visualize the pivot table by using bar chart 

***Example Summary***
Students generally perform slightly better in reading than math.
The gap is largest among students with no test preparation.
Parental education level affects scores — associate’s and master’s degree groups tend to perform better.
Targeted support may be needed for students whose parents didn’t finish high school.
