ðŸŽ¯ Project Motivation
This project is based on the dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams/data), 
which includes exam scores and demographic data of students. The goal is to explore how factors such as parental background, test preparation,
and other social indicators affect student performance â€” with a particular focus on the gap between math and reading scores.

ðŸ§© Problem Statement
Main Question:

Why do some students perform better in math than in reading?

To explore this, I broke the question into sub-questions:

Are students generally scoring higher in math or reading?

Do specific groups (e.g., by gender or parental education level) show significant performance differences?

What external factors â€” such as test preparation course completion or lunch type â€” might influence performance?

ðŸ“Š Approach
Step 1: Data Grouping
I grouped the data by:

Gender

Parental level of education

This helped in identifying consistent patterns across demographic groups.

Step 2: Visualization
To compare average scores, I created a pivot table and visualized the results using bar charts, highlighting differences in math and reading performance.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
On average, students perform slightly better in reading than in math.

The performance gap is most pronounced among students who did not complete test preparation.

Parental education level has a noticeable impact: students whose parents hold an associate's or masterâ€™s degree tend to perform better across all subjects.

Students whose parents did not complete high school may benefit from additional academic support.

This analysis offers a starting point for deeper exploration into educational inequality and can help inform targeted interventions.
